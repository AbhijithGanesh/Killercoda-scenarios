# Let build our applicaiton/bring it over

We'll be running through a flask application for this tutorial! One can use _Django/FastAPI_ similarly

To create a flask application, run the following command:

```sh
./create_flask.sh
```

Through this application we'll be able to serve our hello_world application!

## You can replace this with any other flask application, you can choose to clone your repository over here.
